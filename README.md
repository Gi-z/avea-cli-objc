# avea-cli-objc
An Objective-C port of VFUC's avea-cli. (https://github.com/VFUC/avea-cli)

<h1>Why did I make this?</h1>

1. I was bored.
2. I really wanted to change the colour of my lightbulb with my Glass XE Unit, and this was the easiest way for me to start towards doing that.
3. I only had the most recent Xcode-beta installed, which didn't have Swift 2, which meant I couldn't use VFUC's avea-cli.
4. I don't have a subscribed Apple Developer account, so I had no access to the Swift 3 docs.
5. I like Objective-C.

<h1>Disclaimer</h1>

My Avea bulb is faulty (I think), in that it is completely unable to turn Red, and/or use any Red in producing colours whatsoever. I cannot determine whether or not it was the development of this project that I either broke the bulb, or the bulb suffered a manufacturing fault. Either way, I cannot:

1. Test the red functionality of this application.
2. Confirm that this program will not break the red functionality of your Elgato Avea bulb.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
